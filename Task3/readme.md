DIP Task 3 - Working / Actions Performed

This notebook demonstrates image enhancement techniques using Python and OpenCV. The actions performed are:

Upload Image: Upload an image from the local system to Google Colab.

Read Image: Load the uploaded image from bytes using OpenCV.

Convert to Grayscale: Convert the original color image to a grayscale image for processing.

Histogram Equalization (Built-in): Apply OpenCV’s built-in function to enhance image contrast by equalizing the histogram.

Custom Histogram Equalization: Implement histogram equalization manually using NumPy to understand the process step by step.

Contrast Stretching: Perform contrast stretching to expand the intensity range of the grayscale image, improving visibility of details.

Visualization: Display all results side by side for easy comparison:

Original grayscale image

Built-in histogram equalization result

Custom histogram equalization result

Contrast stretched image

Output:

Enhanced images showing improved contrast and detail visibility.

Visual comparison helps understand differences between techniques.
