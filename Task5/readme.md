DIP Task 5 - Working / Actions Performed

This notebook demonstrates image noise removal and filtering techniques using Python, PIL, NumPy, and SciPy. The actions performed are:

Upload Image: Upload a noisy image from the local system to Google Colab.

Read and Convert Image: Load the uploaded image and convert it to grayscale for processing.

Display Original Image: Show the original noisy grayscale image.

Mean Filter: Apply a mean (average) filter to smooth the image and reduce noise.

Median Filter: Apply a median filter to remove salt-and-pepper noise while preserving edges.

Mode Filter: Apply a mode filter to replace each pixel with the most frequent value in its neighborhood, reducing noise.

Gaussian Filter: Apply a Gaussian filter to smooth the image using a weighted kernel, reducing high-frequency noise.

Visual Comparison: Display all filtered images along with the original image side by side to compare the effects of different filtering techniques.

Output:

Enhanced images with reduced noise.

Visual demonstration of different filtering methods (mean, median, mode, Gaussian).
